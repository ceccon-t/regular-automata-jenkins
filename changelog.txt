=============
Version 1.1.1
---
- Does nothing, just testing Jenkins. 
- Added Jenkinsfile.

=============
Version 1.1.0
---
- Added changelog
- Standardization of format of files for automata
- No longer necessary to convert automaton before recognizing words, all types of automata now have a recognize method
- Added NFAe data structure 
- Added NFA to NFAe conversion 
- Added deterministic version as a private property for non-deterministic automata, to avoid running conversion many times when recognizing lists of words
- Added all possible conversions between the types of automata
- Changed behavior of load button on GUI to always load automata as the tightest type possible given its structure (prevalence order: DFA -> NFA -> NFAe)
- Added buttons to convert current automaton to NFA or NFAe
- Added button to clear table of words
- Added information about type and number of states of the automaton on GUI
- Refactored storage classes to have static methods  

=============
Version 1.0.0
---
- Initial release
- User can load NFAs from files
- User can load list of words from files
- User can convert NFA loaded to DFA
- User must convert NFA to DFA before being able to recognize words
- User can run a list of words through automaton loaded and see which ones were recognized
